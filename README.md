# **Global Terrorism Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## **Project Overview**
This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which contains records of terrorist events worldwide from 1970 to 2017. The primary objective of this project is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the data that can help in understanding the dynamics of global terrorism. These insights are intended to inform and guide strategies for mitigating the impact of terrorism on a global scale.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) provided by the START Consortium at the University of Maryland. The dataset includes various features such as the date and location of the attack, the weapons used, the types of attacks, the targets, and the number of casualties.

- **Source**: [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/)
- **Time Period**: 1970 - 2017
- **Size**: 181,691 records

## **Usage**
The Jupyter Notebook contains all the code and analysis performed on the dataset. You can use this notebook to:
- Understand the structure and contents of the dataset.
- Follow the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- Explore various univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
- Generate insights and visualize patterns in the data.

## **Results**
The project uncovered several key insights, including:
- Identification of high-risk regions and time periods for terrorist activity.
- Analysis of the most lethal attack and weapon types.
- Insights into the collaboration between terrorist groups.
- Relationships between the number of incidents, success rates, and casualties.

These findings are presented through various visualizations, including bar plots, scatter plots, and box plots.

## **Conclusions**
The analysis provides a comprehensive view of global terrorism trends and patterns. These insights are valuable for policymakers, security agencies, and researchers aiming to understand and combat terrorism. The findings emphasize the importance of region-specific and attack-type-specific strategies in reducing the impact of terrorism.

## **Recommendations**
Based on the insights, the following recommendations are proposed:
- Allocate more resources to high-risk regions during peak periods.
- Implement advanced detection and preventive measures against high-casualty attack types.
- Enhance intelligence operations to prevent multi-group collaborations.
- Improve emergency response capabilities in vulnerable areas.
